zarfy - a graphical front end to RandR >=1.2
=============================================

Written by Jim Allingham <supergring0@yahoo.com>
zarfy is Software Libre released under version 3 of the GPL.


INSTALLATION
============

To install from tarball:

>tar -xf zarfy-0.1.0.tar.gz
>cd zarfy-0.1.0
>./configure
>make
as root> make install

"make uninstall" will remove all files installed by this program.


DEPENDENCIES
============

gtk+-2.0
gdk-pixbuf
libglade
libxrandr
libxrender

For Debian & debian-based distros

apt-get install gdk-pixbuf gdk-pixbuf-dev libglade2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxrender-dev

should do it.


LOAD & EXIT MODE
================

Command: zarfy -l

Loads the last configuration and exits - no gui.
Can be used eg. to configure displays on startup:
system->preferences->sessions->startup programs->add zarfy -l


QUICK-SWITCH MODE
=================

Command: zarfy -s

Lets you quickly switch between combinations of displays, simlar to
the Fn key function of a certain well-known propietary OS :)
Use the right & left arrow keys to step between combos, Enter to
select & exit. Or use the mouse - click to select, double click to
execute & exit.

The follwing sample script (Debian) may be tied to the appropriate
acpi Fn key. The first keystroke launches zarfy in switch mode,
successive keystrokes step thorough the possible combinations.

#!/bin/bash
test -f /usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs || exit 0
. /etc/default/acpi-support
. /usr/share/acpi-support/power-funcs
. /usr/share/acpi-support/key-constants

if pidof zarfy; then
	acpi_fakekey $KEY_RIGHT
else 
 for x in /tmp/.X11-unix/*; do
    displaynum=`echo $x | sed s#/tmp/.X11-unix/X##`
    getXuser;
    if [ x"$XAUTHORITY" != x"" ]; then
        export DISPLAY=":$displaynum.0"
	/usr/local/bin/zarfy -s &
    fi
 done
fi


SCRIPTING FOR ROTATE/REFLECT
============================

Automate rotation/relection on your input device (eg. wacom).
Upon execution of rotate/reflect on a display, zarfy looks for
a script associated with that display and, if found, executes it
with one of the following arguments: "rotate_none", "rotate_left",
"rotate_right", "rotate_180", "refect_x", "reflect_y", "unreflect_x",
"unreflect_y". The script must be located in

~/.zarfy/<x_display_name>/

and have the name <output_device>_RR.sh, where <output_device>
is the driver-specifc name of the device (eg Intel "LVDS", "VGA", etc).
Device names for your system are displayed under the thumbnails
at the top of the main zarfy window. The <x_display_name> for the
default display is created automatically the first time you run zarfy.
